  The joint that joins the upper arm to the forearm is the elbow. It is a synovial hinge joint.
  It enables the forearm and hand to be moved toward and away from the body, and is a hinge joint between the upper and the forearm.
  Radius is the part of the forearm which helps in twisting of our elbow (placed at the thumb side of the arm), while Ulna keeps the forearm stable and helps in contraction and expansion of the forearm.
